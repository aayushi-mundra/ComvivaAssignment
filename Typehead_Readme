For Typehead suggestions <TRIE> data structure is used.

1) A Trie Data Structure stores characters of a word at each level.
So we can efficiently insert and get the suggestions of any substring.

Classes
1) TrieNode : assignment.ques2.TrieNode -> Class representation of TrieNode.
Each node has information about 
	1)Its character 
	2) All the immediate childNodes 
	3) Immediate child nodes are stored in Map with key as character and value as TrieNode, for fast access.
	4) Words that this node represents. 
2) TypeHeadTasks: assignment.ques2.TypeHeadTasks -> Class where TrieNode's insert and getSuggestion methods are defined.
3) TypeheadSuggestionImpl : assignment.ques2.TypeheadSuggestionImpl -> class with main method
4) TypeHeadSuggestionTest : assignment.ques2.test.TypeHeadSuggestionTest -> Test class with JUnit test cases.
