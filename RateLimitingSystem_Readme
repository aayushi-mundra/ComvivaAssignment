1) There are various algo for Rate Limiting :
	1) Leaky Bucket : All the incoming requests are placed in a queue. 
					  If the queue is full new requests are discarded.
	2) Fixed Window : here window size is fixed of n sec/hour etc. Request is discarded if the counter exceeds the max limit.
	3) Sliding Window : Here we take the incoming request's timestamp and compare with all the prev request timestamp.
						All the outdated requests are removed.
						now if the log size is greater than the max limit request is discarded, else it is served and counter is increased.


2) The Rate Limiter Service: Algo ->Sliding Window
	1) All incoming requests needs to be registered.
	2) It contains : Request Data -> to store all request made by one key(example userID)
	3) Evaluation Service: Based on analysis of the request data, <Evaluation Service> decided to forward or discard a service.
	4) some aggregation is required on the input request in a given time frame
	
3) Cleanup Service -> will be responsible for removing the older data.

4) DataBase: Because the data size is large here, we will be using Key-value based No-SQL DB like MongoDB.

5) Sync Service : we need this to Sync the data between Disk DB and Cache memory. We need Cache here for faster computations.
